# Insertion Sort

## Model Design

### Insertion Sort Problem

To avoid exerting redundant comparing operation when already having parts of ordered objects, we come out with this new sort algorithms, which is more efficient than selection sort.

* **Abstraction**: 
  * Use`array[N]` to abstract these unordered objects 
  * Sort items, corresponding to the sequence of ordered index of array.
* **Define** _**insertion**_
  * The idea of insertion is that we want 
* **Consider invariant**
